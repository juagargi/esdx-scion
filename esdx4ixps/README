# Spot Market

The spot market is a virtual market where sellers can post their bandwidth offers
on the whiteboard, and buyers can buy part or the total amount of the offer.

An offer contains a bandwidth profile (bandwidth vs time) and a path policy (what ASes can
be reached using this offer).

## Development

### Install pip packages:
```bash
rm -rf .venv
python3 -m venv .venv
echo '*' > .venv/.gitignore
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt
```

### Add new dependencies:
The project uses pip-tools. Edit the `requirements.in` file and generate a new `requirements.txt`
for pip to use:
```bash
pip-compile --generate-hashes --allow-unsafe --output-file=requirements.txt requirements.in
```

### Run tests
Ensure you are in the directory containing the `manage.py` file.
Then activate the virtual environment created above, if not active already
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

And then run
```bash
make test
make integration
```
